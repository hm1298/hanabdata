# Hanabdata

This repo is intended to help analyze player, seed, and game data from hanab.live. 

## Dependencies

- Python3 -- likely pandas in the future, but we're not there yet. 
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

To install, run
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt


## Scripts 

Run scripts (.py files in top level folder): you'll end up with raw JSON data from hanab.live in src/data/raw/ and processed CSV reports in src/data/processed/. 

## CSVs

Currently there is no local statistical processing of generated csvs. To view and anaylze the csvs, I recommend using Google Sheets.
